      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced by numerous economic,
        technical, and behavioral factors. This project focuses on analyzing historical
        Bitcoin price data to understand market behavior and predict future price movements
        using data science and machine learning techniques.

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The key challenge is determining whether historical Bitcoin price data can be used
        to identify meaningful patterns that help predict future price movements. Due to
        high volatility and correlated variables, feature selection and model evaluation
        play a critical role in building reliable predictions.

      <h2>Data Understanding & Exploratory Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset consists of historical open, high, low, and close (OHLC) price values.
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to examine trends over time, analyze
        distributions, and study correlations between variables.

  <p>
    Visual analysis was performed to understand relationships between variables
    and evaluate model performance. The correlation heatmap highlights dependencies
    among price features, while the confusion matrix evaluates the predictive
    accuracy of the predictive model.
