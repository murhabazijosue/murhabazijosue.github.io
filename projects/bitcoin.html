      <h1>Bitcoin Market Analysis & Price Movement Prediction</h1>
      <p>
        A data science project focused on understanding Bitcoin price behavior and
        predicting market movement using historical data and machine learning techniques.

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced by a wide range of factors,
    making price behavior difficult to interpret and predict. Understanding historical
    trends and patterns is essential for market analysis, risk assessment, and informed
    decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project focuses on analyzing historical Bitcoin price data to uncover market
    behavior, identify meaningful relationships between price features, and develop
    machine learning models to predict price movement trends.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    The core challenge addressed in this project is determining whether historical price
    data can be used to identify patterns that help predict future Bitcoin price movements.
    Due to high volatility and correlated market variables, feature selection and model
    evaluation play a critical role in building reliable predictions.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Understanding & Exploratory Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset consists of historical Bitcoin price records, including open, high, low,
    and close values. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand price
    distributions, trends over time, and relationships between variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    A correlation analysis was performed to identify highly correlated features and reduce
    redundancy, ensuring that the model focuses on meaningful signals rather than noise.

  <h2>Modeling Approach</h2>
  <p>
    The prediction task was framed as a classification problem to identify price movement
    trends. Machine learning models were trained using selected features, and performance
    was evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess prediction accuracy and consistency.
  </p>
  <p>
    A confusion matrix was used to analyze true versus predicted outcomes, providing insight
    into model strengths and limitations across different market conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Key Learnings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Handling highly correlated financial features</li>
    <li>Managing noisy and volatile time-series data</li>
    <li>Balancing model complexity with interpretability</li>
    <li>Evaluating models beyond accuracy alone</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
  </p>

  <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be applied to
    financial markets to extract insights from historical data. Similar analytical
    approaches are widely used in trading analytics, market research, and risk management
    to support data-driven financial decisions.
  </p>
<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
<p>
  This project highlights my ability to translate real-world problems into data-driven
  solutions by combining analytical thinking, machine learning techniques, and practical
  interpretation of results.
